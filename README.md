# willie-rep
Lets users "luv" and "h8" other users on IRC. Clone of a mIRC script someone
used in a channel I was in.

## Dependencies
Aside from willie and its dependencies, this module has no dependencies.
(`time` is part of the standard Python library.)

## Commands
* `.luv nick`: Adds +1 to the user's reputation score
* `.h8 nick`: Adds -1 to the user's reputation score
