# sopel-rep
Lets users "luv" and "h8" other users on IRC. Functional clone of a mIRC script
someone used in a channel I was in. (Never saw their code, not that I'd want to
do a *port* of anything written for mIRC...)

## Dependencies
Aside from sopel and its dependencies, this module has no dependencies.
(`time` is part of the standard Python library.)

## Commands
* `.luv nick`: Adds +1 to the user's reputation score
* `.h8 nick`: Adds -1 to the user's reputation score
